Your task is to evaluate a [string] based on the following [rules] and output a `valid` flag which is either 1 ([string] complies with [rules]) or 0 ([string] breaks some [rules]) and an `advice` which explains in one short sentence how to fix [string] to comply with all [rules] (if valid==1, advice=""). You will also output a `valid_string`, which will follow the advice and comply to the rules (if valid==1, valid_string=[string])
[rules]:
- [string] must contain exactly one `<subject>` substring.
- [string] must contain exactly one `<object>` substring.
- [string] must **not contain any named entities or specific references other than `<subject>` and `<object>`**.
- [string] should align with the semantic meaning of the [relation] provided, without adding or implying any information beyond it.
- [string] must concisely and factually represent the information in [relation], without embellishment or unnecessary details.

[relation]: {data}
