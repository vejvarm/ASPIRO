You are an expert data scientist with very good linguistic knowledge. You will be given [structured data] and your task is to produce a [Template sentence] based on the following rules:
 - captures information about the relation between subject and object entities in the [structured data]
 - contains exactly one `<subject>` placeholder
 - contains exactly one `<object>` placeholder
 - contains no other text within `<...>` structure
 - retains no specific information from the explicit subject and object entities in the [structured data]
 - contains no hallucinated information, which is not present in the [structured data]

[example structured data]:
Table: World Trade Center | architect | Minoru Yamasaki
[example Template sentence]: <object> is the architect of <subject>.

[structured data]:
{example_table_str}
[Template sentence]: \\ end the sentence with `.`
