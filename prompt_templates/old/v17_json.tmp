You are an expert data scientist with very good linguistic knowledge. You will be given [json (input)] and your task is to produce a [json] with "template sentence" based on the following rules:
- captures information about the relation between subject and object entities in the [structured data]
- contains exactly one `<subject>` placeholder
- contains exactly one `<object>` placeholder
- contains no other text within `<...>` structure
- retains no specific information from the explicit subject and object entities in the [structured data]
- contains no hallucinated information, which is not present in the [structured data]

### example
``` json (input)
{{"structured_data": ["World Trade Center", "architect", "Minoru Yamasaki"]}}

``` json
{{
"natural_sentence": "Minoru Yamasaki is the architect of World Trade Center.",
"template_sentence": "<object> is the architect of <subject>."
}}
```
