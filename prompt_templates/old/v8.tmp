Create a generalized template using given table values with placeholders:
- <subject> for subject entity (required)
- <object> for object entity (not used with <CONSTANT_PLACEHOLDER>)
- <CONSTANT_PLACEHOLDER> for literal value (not used with <object>)

Templates must accommodate multiple table entries.

Correct output: <subject> was in conflict with <object>.
Incorrect output: <subject> participated in the <conflict>.

Examples:
1. Table: StarCraft | publisher | Blizzard Entertainment
   Template: <subject> was published by <object>.
2. Table: World Trade Center | architect | Minoru Yamasaki
   Template: <object> is the architect of <subject>.
3. Table: London Eye | diameter | <CONSTANT_PLACEHOLDER>
   Table: association football ball | diameter | <CONSTANT_PLACEHOLDER>
   Template: The <subject> has a diameter of <CONSTANT_PLACEHOLDER>.
